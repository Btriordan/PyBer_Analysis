# Conclusion
   In Urban areas, there are more people looking to ride with Pyber, but the rides will be shorter and there are more drivers than riders at times.  The rural cities have fewer drivers, the rides are longer and the driver makes more money.  There may be a correlation between how many drivers there are and the average fare, but it is inconclusive with this data.  However, from the analysis, the rural drivers are more profitable because there are less drivers adn the rides are longer.
